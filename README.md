Here, youâ€™ll find my work on cutting-edge technologies like energy-harvesting systems, AI applications, and more. Feel free to explore and connect!

EcoWatch - Energy Harvesting Smartwatch
Description:
EcoWatch is an energy-harvesting smartwatch that uses a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and a solar cell to power the device. This project integrates hardware components like the Arduino Nano, OLED display, and LEDs to display temperature levels and monitor energy generation.

Components Used:
Thermoelectric Module (TEG)
Solar Cell
Arduino Nano
OLED Display
Red, Yellow, Green LEDs
Breadboard and Wires
Working:
The thermoelectric module converts heat into electrical energy.
The solar cell generates power when exposed to light.
The OLED display shows the real-time temperature.
LED indicators show the status of energy (low, medium, or high).
Setup Instructions:
Connect the thermoelectric module and solar cell to the breadboard as shown in the circuit diagram.
Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE.
Power the system using the connected energy sources (heat and light).
Monitor the temperature and power levels displayed on the OLED.
Future Work:
Integrating more eco-friendly technologies.
Improving energy efficiency and adding wireless features.
